Contributing to engage

Hackforla welcomes contributions from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are thinking of helping us:

Contributions

Contributions to the project or its dependencies should be made in form of Github request. Each request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with merge permissions) and be either merged to the main tree or require more changes based on feedback

Pull Request Guidelines


For specific git instructions, see GitHub workflow 101.

Public Resources

Some projects may have public development servers. We reserve the right to ban offenders that engage in this non exhausted list such as DDOS, Malware, etc.

Communication

This subproject meets at Carbon Five side on Monday every week.
